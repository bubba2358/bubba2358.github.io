## 1) Ready Go
##### Synopsis + some first consideration about Python
I wanted to start programming again after a long period of time so, based on what a couple of friends told me, i thought **Python** could be my language of choice. After a couple of weeks of fiddling around i was able to grasp the basics despite the fact that Python in 2017 co-exists in *two versions* (2. and 3.) and this can be quite confusing especially when you try to learn from old examples. Anyway, the first thing i noticed looking at some documentation is that, as a scripting language, Python is not particularly 'fresh'. It reminds me of *Perl* (my first love) and this can infact sound quite old-fashioned. But as you dig deep you discover the infinite galaxy of packages (python libraries) that make the real difference. There are literally thousands of them available for pretty much anything.
