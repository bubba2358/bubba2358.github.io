## Ready Go
I wanted to start programming again after a very long period of time (used to code in Perl) so based on what a couple of friends told me i thought _Python_ could be my language of choice. After a couple of weeks of fiddling around i was able to write some basic stuff but thanks to the thousands python packages out there i decided i was ready for a quite intricate project.
